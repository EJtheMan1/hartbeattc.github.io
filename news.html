      <h2 id="test">Holyoke 10k</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Hartbeat Track Club, a newly-formed group of sub-elite Hartford area runners, began its spring campaign at the Holyoke St. Patrick's Day 10K Road Race in Holyoke, Massachusetts. In a field of nearly 7000 runners, HTC team members placed 1st, 3rd, 7th and 43rd overall, headlined by University of Hartford alumnus and local physical therapist John Busque. Busque, helped by his beautiful sprinter form, outkicked Holyoke’s 2012 champion Zachary Hine to win in a time of 30:37. Next across the line for the team was New England Runner Magazine’s 2017 CT Runner of the Year Everett Hackett. Hackett, without his signature Vibrams, clocked in at 31:13 outkicking 3-time race champion Alene Reta for 3rd place. “I knew I had it in me,” Hackett said after the race. “I just needed my overripe bananas to get me there.” After narrowly making it to the line for the gun - his teammates had to check in for him - University of Chicago alumnus, and current UConn MD/PHD student Tima Karginov placed 7th in 32:31. Former Appalachian State Mountaineer Phil Mitchell closed out the group  in 37:48, good for 43rd. Mitchell, coach of the Hartford Public High School XC & Track teams, is working his way back to the fitness that made him four time Southern Conference XC & Track champion.

Holyoke, MA, offered a bustling atmosphere for the race.  A sea of green shirts overwhelmed the hilly streets overlooking the Connecticut River.  Spectators – actually, partygoers –  began the festivities hours before the gun went off. Packed in a tight huddle on a chilly day, the elite group took off past a roaring and raucous crowd of thousands, hugging the rails for the flat opening half mile. After the mile mark, the race quickly strung out into the ensuing 3-mile climb began. A lead pack of four runners powered up the hill with a thin line of pursuers falling further and further back. As the lead group reached the peak, Busque and Hine broke away, with Reta and Hackett in hot pursuit. A blistering 4:20 downhill mile proved to be a crushing blow for Reta and Hackett as Busque and Craig remained neck and neck. After several attempts by Busque to shake Hine, the latter broke free and powered up the last 100 m. Surely, at this point Busque was on the outside looking in. Yet, he "felt so full of running... This was the chance to do something special.”   In the last 50 m, Busque put on his best sprinter hands, blasting by Hine for the win to  cheers of “Go Zachary!”  Following Busque’s suit, Hackett managed to rein in Reta, all smiles as he crossed the line. “I put my head down and prayed he didn’t sneak by me again before the line,” Busque said about his effort. “It was a fun day; I’ll be back to this one in the future.” As for Mitchell, when asked about his race, he commented: “According to the locals, I was keeping up with ‘the first hot chick.’”

Up next, Hartbeat TC has set its sights on the Bison Outdoor Classic 10K and 5K on April 15 at Bucknell College in Lewisburg, PA.
